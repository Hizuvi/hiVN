Repo for the HIZUVI visual novel maker, a tool for Unity to make visual novels

Hi!

Glad you found your way here! 
Let me talk a bit about the license for this project.
I just want you to be able to use this with as little hassle as possible, for all projects. No matter if it's a dialogue system in an rpg, a stylish cutscene or, of course, a visual novel.
So whatever you use this for, no matter what it is, I want you to credit where credit is due. If you use as a basis for the whole game, then I would appreciate if you credit to either me in the game/program ar at least show that it was made using the "HIZUVI novel maker".
If you use this for a tiny or small part of the game, then do what you think is approperiate. I put my trust in you for this, because I want to put as much power as possible into your hands.



If you don't know what this is, then here is a simple explaination(with images!):
